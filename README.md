# KeyboardEvent

### [View the live version](http://www.jasperandrew.me/KeyboardEvent/)

Thanks to Wes Bos (the creator of [keycode.info](http://www.keycode.info)) for the original version, and a somewhat sarcastic thanks to MDN for deprecating [`KeyboardEvent.keyCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) so I was forced to refactor a project to handle [`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) instead. Also a slightly more serious thanks to MDN for providing the [tables upon tables of key values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) from which I scraped almost all of the key values and descriptions.

Feel free to suggest improvements or fork the project!
